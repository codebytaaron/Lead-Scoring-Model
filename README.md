# Lead Scoring Model

This repository documents a lead scoring system designed to evaluate and prioritize inbound leads using data and behavioral signals.

The full implementation is private. This repo explains what the system does at a high level.

If you want to review the model logic or discuss real-world use cases, contact me directly.

---

## What it does

For each lead, the system outputs:

- A score from **0 to 100**
- A qualification level: **High / Medium / Low**
- The **key signals** that influenced the score

This helps sales and marketing teams focus attention on leads most likely to convert.

## Inputs used

The model can work with a wide range of signals, including:

- User or company attributes
- Engagement and behavior signals
- Source and acquisition channel
- Custom business rules

Inputs are flexible and can be adapted to different pipelines.

## How it works (high level)

The system is designed to stay simple, explainable, and easy to integrate.

## Design goals

- Clear and explainable scoring logic
- Handles messy, real-world data
- Easy to customize and extend
- Built for practical sales and marketing use

## Tech (high level)

- Python
- Data processing logic
- Rule-based and weighted scoring

## Access

The full model and scoring logic are not public.

If you want a demo, walkthrough, or access to the implementation, reach out to discuss.
