Lead Scoring Model
This repository documents a lead scoring system built to evaluate and prioritize inbound leads based on data and behavior.
The full implementation is private. This repo explains what the system does at a high level.
If you want to see the model, review the logic, or discuss use cases, contact me directly.
What It Does
For each lead, the system produces:
A lead score (0–100)
A basic qualification level (high, medium, low)
Key signals that influenced the score
This helps teams focus on the leads most likely to convert.
Inputs Used
The model can work with data such as:
User or company information
Engagement and behavior signals
Source and acquisition channel
Custom business rules
Inputs are flexible and can be adjusted per use case.
