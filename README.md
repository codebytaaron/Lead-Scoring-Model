# Lead Scoring Model

This repository documents a lead scoring system designed to evaluate and prioritize inbound leads using data and behavioral signals.

The full implementation is private. This repository explains what the system does at a high level.

If you want to see the model, review the logic, or discuss real-world use cases, contact me directly.

## What This Does

For each lead, the system outputs:

- A lead score from 0 to 100  
- A qualification level: High, Medium, or Low  
- The key signals that influenced the score  

This allows sales and marketing teams to focus on the leads most likely to convert.

## Inputs Used

The model can work with a wide range of data, including:

- User or company information  
- Engagement and behavior signals  
- Source and acquisition channel  
- Custom business rules  

Inputs are flexible and can be adapted to different businesses and pipelines.
